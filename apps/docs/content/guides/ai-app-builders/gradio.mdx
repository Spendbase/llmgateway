Gradio is a Python library for building ML demos and web interfaces. It provides pre-built components for creating chat interfaces, image classifiers, and other AI-powered UIs with minimal code.

Gradio apps can integrate LLM API through the OpenAI Python SDK for chat and text generation features.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Gradio installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Use LLM API in Gradio Apps

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install gradio openai
```

2. Build a Gradio chat interface with LLM API:

```python
import gradio as gr
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
api_key="your-llm-api-key-here",
base_url="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
)
def chat(message, history):
response = client.chat.completions.create(
model="openai/gpt-4o",
messages=[{"role":"user","content":message}]
)
return response.choices[0].message.content
gr.ChatInterface(chat).launch()
```

3. Run: python app.py

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Gradio can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>

<Callout type="info">
	Gradio's ChatInterface component works out of the box with LLM API for rapid
	prototyping.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Gradio

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests

<Callout type="info">
	View all available models on the [models page](https://llmapi.ai/models).
