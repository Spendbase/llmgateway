The Vercel AI SDK is an open-source TypeScript toolkit for building AI-powered applications. It provides React hooks and server-side utilities for streaming AI responses, with support for multiple model providers.

The AI SDK supports custom OpenAI-compatible providers through its createOpenAI function.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Vercel AI SDK installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API with Vercel AI SDK

1. Install the AI SDK:

```bash
npm install ai \@ai-sdk/openai
```

2. Configure the OpenAI-compatible provider in your code:

```python
import { createOpenAI } from "\@ai-sdk/openai";
const llmapi = createOpenAI({
apiKey: "your-llm-api-key-here",
baseURL: "https://api.llmapi.ai/v1",
});
// Use in your application
const result = await generateText({
model: llmapi("openai/gpt-4o"),
prompt: "Hello!",
});
```

3. Deploy your application --- it will use LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Vercel AI SDK can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	The AI SDK's streaming support works seamlessly with LLM API for real-time
	response display.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Vercel AI SDK

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests

<Callout type="info">
	View all available models on the [models page](https://llmapi.ai/models).
