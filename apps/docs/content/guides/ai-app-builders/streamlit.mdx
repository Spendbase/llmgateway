Streamlit is a Python framework for building data apps and AI interfaces. It makes it easy to create interactive web applications with just a few lines of Python code, commonly used for AI chat interfaces and dashboards.

Streamlit apps can use the OpenAI Python SDK configured with LLM API's endpoint.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Streamlit installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Use LLM API in Streamlit Apps

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit openai
```

2. Configure LLM API in your Streamlit app:

```python
import streamlit as st
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
api_key="your-llm-api-key-here",
base_url="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
model="openai/gpt-4o",
messages=[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]
)
```

3. Run your app: streamlit run app.py

```yaml
Tip: Store your LLM API key in Streamlit's secrets management (st.secrets) for secure deployment.
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Streamlit can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Streamlit

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
