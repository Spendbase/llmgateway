Retool is a low-code platform for building internal tools, dashboards, and admin panels. It supports connecting to hundreds of data sources and APIs, with built-in AI capabilities that can be powered by custom LLM providers.

Retool's resource configuration supports custom API authentication, allowing you to connect LLM API as an AI data source.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Retool installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API as a Resource in Retool

1. Log in to your Retool instance.
2. Navigate to Resources → "Create New" → "REST API".
3. Configure the resource with the following details:
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **Headers**: Add \"Authorization\" header with value \"Bearer your-llm-api-key-here\"
4. Name the resource (e.g., "LLM API") and click "Save".
5. In your Retool app, add a query using the LLM API resource.
6. Use POST requests to /chat/completions with your desired model and messages.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Retool can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Retool

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
