Sider is an AI-powered browser extension and sidebar that brings ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other AI models to every webpage you visit. It offers features like page summarization, writing assistance, translation, and custom AI actions --- all accessible from a convenient sidebar.

Sider supports bring-your-own-key configurations, allowing you to connect LLM API for model access.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Sider installed or accessible

## Setup

### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)
