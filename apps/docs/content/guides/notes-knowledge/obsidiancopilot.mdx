Obsidian CoPilot is a plugin for the Obsidian knowledge management app that adds AI-powered features including chat, text generation, summarization, and semantic search across your notes vault.

Obsidian CoPilot supports custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints in its plugin settings.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Obsidian Copilot installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Obsidian CoPilot

1. Open Obsidian and navigate to Settings → Community Plugins → CoPilot.
2. In the CoPilot settings, find the LLM Provider section.
3. Select "OpenAI" or "Custom" as the provider.
4. Enter:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Set the model name.
6. Close settings and use CoPilot in your vault.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Obsidian Copilot can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Obsidian Copilot

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
