Logseq is an open-source knowledge management and note-taking application with outliner-style editing. Its AI features support custom LLM providers for intelligent note assistance.

Logseq's AI plugin supports custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Logseq installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Logseq

1. Open Logseq and navigate to Settings → Plugins.
2. Install or open the AI/LLM plugin settings.
3. Select "OpenAI Compatible".
4. Enter:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Set the model name.
6. Close settings.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Logseq can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Logseq

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
