Smart Connections is an Obsidian plugin that uses AI to find connections between your notes and provide an AI chat interface that understands your knowledge base.

Smart Connections supports custom API endpoints for its AI features.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Obsidian Smart Connections installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Smart Connections

1. Open Obsidian Settings → Smart Connections.
2. In the "Chat Model" section, select "Custom / OpenAI-compatible".
3. Enter:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **API URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **Model**: openai/gpt-4o
4. Close settings.

</Step>
