Letta (formerly MemGPT) is a framework for building stateful AI agents with long-term memory. It manages context windows intelligently, allowing agents to maintain persistent conversations and knowledge across sessions.

Letta supports custom LLM endpoints, letting you connect LLM API for agent intelligence.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Letta installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Letta

1. Set environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-llm-api-key-here"
export OPENAI_API_BASE="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
```

2. Or configure in Letta's config:

```
letta configure
\# When prompted:
\# LLM Provider: openai
\# Base URL: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
\# API Key: your-llm-api-key-here
```

3. Create and run agents --- they will use LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Letta can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	Letta's memory management works best with models that have strong instruction
	following. LLM API gives you access to the best options.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Letta

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
