Composio is a platform that provides AI agents with access to 250+ tools and integrations. It connects to services like GitHub, Slack, Gmail, and databases, enabling agents to perform real-world actions across your tech stack.

Composio supports custom LLM providers for the AI agents powering its tool integrations.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Composio installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Composio

1. Install Composio and set up your workspace.
2. Configure the LLM provider:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-llm-api-key-here"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
```

3. Or configure in code:

```python
from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
api_key="your-llm-api-key-here",
base_url="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
)
```

4. Run your agents with Composio tools powered by LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Composio can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	Composio's tool integrations work with any OpenAI-compatible model through LLM
	API.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Composio

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
