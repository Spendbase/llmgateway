OpenAI Codex CLI is an open-source coding agent that runs in your terminal. It can write and edit code, run commands, and work through multi-step tasks using large language models with full sandbox safety.

Codex CLI supports custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints via environment variables.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- OpenAI Codex installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Codex CLI

1. Set environment variables before launching Codex:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-llm-api-key-here"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
```

2. Launch Codex:

```
codex
```

3. All AI requests will now go through LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that OpenAI Codex can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	OPENAI\_BASE\_URL overrides the default endpoint. Codex CLI will use LLM API
	for all model requests.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with OpenAI Codex

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests

<Callout type="info">
	View all available models on the [models page](https://llmapi.ai/models).
