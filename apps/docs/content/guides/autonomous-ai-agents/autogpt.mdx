AutoGPT is an open-source autonomous AI agent framework that can chain together LLM calls to accomplish complex goals. It can browse the web, write code, manage files, and interact with various services --- all autonomously.

AutoGPT supports custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints through its .env configuration.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- AutoGPT installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in AutoGPT

1. Open the .env file in your AutoGPT installation.
2. Set the following variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-llm-api-key-here
OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
SMART_LLM=openai/gpt-4o
FAST_LLM=openai/gpt-4o-mini
```

3. Save the .env file.
4. Start AutoGPT --- all AI calls will route through LLM API.

```yaml
Tip: AutoGPT uses two model tiers (SMART and FAST). You can assign different LLM API models to each for cost optimization.
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that AutoGPT can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with AutoGPT

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
