Agent Zero is a personal AI assistant framework that is organic, self-developing, and fully transparent. It operates in a Docker-based environment and can execute code, browse the web, communicate with other agents, and learn from interactions --- all while keeping its AI backbone completely configurable.

Agent Zero supports OpenAI-compatible APIs as the main LLM backend, making it simple to connect LLM API as your provider.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Agent Zero installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Agent Zero

1. Clone and set up Agent Zero following the installation instructions.
2. Open the .env file in the project root (copy .env.example if it doesn't exist).
3. Set the following environment variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-llm-api-key-here
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
CHAT_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o
```

4. Save the .env file.
5. Start Agent Zero --- it will use LLM API for all AI interactions.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Agent Zero can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	Agent Zero uses the OpenAI SDK internally. Setting OPENAI\_API\_BASE redirects
	all requests to LLM API while maintaining full compatibility.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Agent Zero

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests

	View all available models on the [models page](https://llmapi.ai/models).
