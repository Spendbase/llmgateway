CrewAI is a framework for building multi-agent AI systems. It allows you to define specialized AI agents with specific roles, tools, and goals that collaborate to accomplish complex tasks.

CrewAI supports custom LLM providers through its configuration, including OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- CrewAI installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in CrewAI

1. Set environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-llm-api-key-here"
export OPENAI_API_BASE="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
```

2. Or configure inline in your crew definition:

```python
from crewai import Agent, LLM
llm = LLM(
model="openai/gpt-4o",
api_key="your-llm-api-key-here",
base_url="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
)
agent = Agent(
role="Researcher",
goal="Find information",
llm=llm
)
```

3. All agents in the crew will use LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that CrewAI can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	Each agent in CrewAI can use a different model. LLM API lets you mix models
	with a single key.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with CrewAI

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests

<Callout type="info">
	View all available models on the [models page](https://llmapi.ai/models).
