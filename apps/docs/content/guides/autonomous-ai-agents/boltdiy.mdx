Bolt.diy is an open-source AI-powered full-stack web development agent. Forked from Bolt.new, it runs in your browser and can generate, edit, and deploy complete web applications using AI, with support for custom model providers.

Bolt.diy supports custom OpenAI-compatible providers, letting you bring your own LLM API key.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Bolt.diy installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Bolt.diy

1. Open your Bolt.diy instance.
2. Navigate to Settings (gear icon).
3. Under "Providers," find or add "OpenAI Compatible".
4. Enter:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Select the model.
6. Click "Save" --- Bolt.diy will use LLM API for code generation.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Bolt.diy can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

<Callout type="info">
	Bolt.diy's code generation quality depends heavily on the model. LLM API lets
	you use the most capable models available.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Bolt.diy

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
