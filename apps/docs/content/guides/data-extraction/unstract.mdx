Unstract is a no-code platform for building document extraction workflows powered by large language models. It allows teams to create APIs that automatically extract structured data from unstructured documents like invoices, contracts, and forms.

Unstract supports custom LLM providers for its extraction workflows, allowing you to connect LLM API as the AI backend.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Unstract installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Unstract

1. Log in to your Unstract dashboard.
2. Navigate to the LLM Provider or Model Configuration settings.
3. Add a new provider and select "OpenAI Compatible".
4. Enter the following details:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **Model**: the model ID you wish to use (e.g., openai/gpt-4o)
5. Click "Save" to store the configuration.
6. Select LLM API as the provider when building your extraction workflows.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Unstract can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

<Callout type="info">
	Different extraction tasks may benefit from different models. LLM API gives
	you the flexibility to choose the right model for each workflow.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Unstract

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
