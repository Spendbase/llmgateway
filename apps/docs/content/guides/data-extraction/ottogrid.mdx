OttoGrid is an AI-powered data analysis and automation platform that helps users process, analyze, and extract insights from data at scale. It provides API access for integrating AI-driven data workflows into your existing tools and pipelines.

OttoGrid supports custom API authentication, allowing you to connect LLM API as your model provider for data analysis tasks.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- OttoGrid installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in OttoGrid

1. Log in to your OttoGrid account.
2. Navigate to Settings → API Configuration.
3. Select "OpenAI Compatible" or "Custom LLM" as the provider.
4. Enter the following details:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **Model**: the model ID you wish to use (e.g., openai/gpt-4o)
5. Click "Save" to apply the configuration.
6. Your OttoGrid workflows will now use LLM API for AI-powered analysis.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that OttoGrid can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.
