Weaviate is an open-source vector database with built-in support for AI model integrations. It supports generative search, where retrieved results are passed to an LLM for summarization or answer generation.

Weaviate's generative modules support custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Weaviate installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API with Weaviate

1. Configure Weaviate's generative module:

```
OPENAI_APIKEY=your-llm-api-key-here
OPENAI_BASEURL=https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
```

2. Or in collection config:

```
collection.configure.generative(
generative_provider="openai",
model="openai/gpt-4o",
api_key="your-llm-api-key-here",
base_url="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
)
```

3. Use generative search queries powered by LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Weaviate can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Weaviate

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
