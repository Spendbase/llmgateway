Chroma is an open-source embedding database designed for AI applications. It makes it easy to build LLM apps with embeddings and retrieval-augmented generation.

Chroma-based RAG apps can use LLM API for the generation step.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Chroma installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Use LLM API with Chroma RAG

1. Set up Chroma and create a collection.
2. Configure LLM API for generation:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
api_key="your-llm-api-key-here",
base_url="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
)
```

3. Query Chroma for context, then pass to LLM API for answers.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Chroma can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	Chroma's in-memory mode is great for prototyping RAG apps with LLM API.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Chroma

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
