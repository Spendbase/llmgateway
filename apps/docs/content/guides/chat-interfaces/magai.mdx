Magai is an AI content platform that provides a unified interface for multiple AI models. It supports chat, image generation, and content creation workflows with bring-your-own-key functionality.

Magai supports custom API keys for direct model access through its settings.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Magai installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)
