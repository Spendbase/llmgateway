Open WebUI is a self-hosted, feature-rich web interface for interacting with large language models. It supports multiple providers including OpenAI, Ollama, and any OpenAI-compatible API, with built-in user management, chat history, and model switching.

Open WebUI's connection manager lets you add any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, making it simple to integrate LLM API and access all available models.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Open WebUI installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Open WebUI

1. Open your Open WebUI instance in a browser.
2. Navigate to Admin Settings (⚙️ icon) → Connections → OpenAI → Manage.
3. Click the ➕ (Add New Connection) button.
4. Enter the following details:
   - **URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
5. Click "Save" to store the credentials.
6. LLM API models will now appear in the model dropdown when starting a new chat.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Open WebUI can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

	You can leave the Model IDs field empty for auto-detection, or specify a list
	of model IDs to limit which models appear in the dropdown.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Open WebUI

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
