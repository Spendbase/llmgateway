AICamp is a team AI platform that provides a shared workspace for using AI models collaboratively. It supports multiple providers and the option to bring your own model API keys, making it ideal for teams that want centralized AI access with cost control.

AICamp's Bring Your Own Model feature supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints, letting administrators connect LLM API for the entire team.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- AICamp installed or accessible

### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)
