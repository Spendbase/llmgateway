MindMac is a native macOS AI chat client that supports multiple providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints. It offers a clean interface with markdown rendering and conversation management.

MindMac supports custom API providers, making it simple to connect LLM API.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- MindMac installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>

### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)
