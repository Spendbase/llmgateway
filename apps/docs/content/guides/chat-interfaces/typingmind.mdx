TypingMind is a polished web-based chat interface for AI models. It supports OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and custom OpenAI-compatible providers, with features like chat folders, prompt library, plugins, and the ability to bring your own API keys.

TypingMind's custom model feature lets you add any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, including LLM API.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- TypingMind installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in TypingMind

1. Open TypingMind in your browser.
2. Click your Profile (bottom left) → "API Keys" button.
3. Under the OpenAI section, enter your LLM API key (this will be used for OpenAI-compatible routing).
4. Open the Model settings in the left panel and click "Add Custom Models".
5. Enter the following details:
   - **API Endpoint**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1/chat/completions
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Model Name**: the model ID you wish to use (e.g., openai/gpt-4o)
6. Click "Save" --- the model will appear in your model selector.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that TypingMind can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	TypingMind stores API keys locally in your browser. Your key is never sent to
	TypingMind's servers.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with TypingMind

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
