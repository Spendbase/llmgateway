LibreChat is an open-source, self-hosted AI chat platform that supports multiple providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. It features multi-model conversations, plugins, and file handling.

LibreChat's configuration file supports custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, making it easy to add LLM API.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- LibreChat installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in LibreChat

1. Open the librechat.yaml configuration file.
2. Add LLM API as a custom endpoint:

```
endpoints:
custom:
\- name: "LLM API"
apiKey: "\${LLM_API_KEY}"
baseURL: "https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
models:
default: ["openai/gpt-4o", "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet"]
```

3. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export LLM_API_KEY="your-llm-api-key-here"
```

4. Restart LibreChat --- LLM API will appear as a provider in the UI.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that LibreChat can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	LibreChat can show multiple providers side by side, letting you compare LLM
	API models with other services.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with LibreChat

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
