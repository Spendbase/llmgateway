AnythingLLM is a full-stack desktop and Docker application for building private AI assistants. It supports document ingestion, vector search, and chat capabilities with multiple LLM providers --- all running locally or connecting to cloud APIs.

AnythingLLM's provider configuration supports custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, making it easy to connect LLM API.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- AnythingLLM installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in AnythingLLM

1. Open AnythingLLM (desktop app or web interface).
2. Navigate to Settings → LLM Preference.
3. Select "Generic OpenAI" as the LLM provider.
4. Enter the following details:
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Model**: the model ID you wish to use (e.g., openai/gpt-4o)
5. Set the token limit according to your chosen model.
6. Click "Save changes" to apply.
7. Start a new workspace chat --- all AI requests will now go through LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that AnythingLLM can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	AnythingLLM's "Generic OpenAI" provider works with any OpenAI-compatible API.
	You can combine LLM API with AnythingLLM's local document processing for a
	powerful private AI assistant.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with AnythingLLM

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
