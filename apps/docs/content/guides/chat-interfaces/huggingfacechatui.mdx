Hugging Face Chat UI is an open-source web interface for interacting with language models. It supports multiple providers including OpenAI-compatible endpoints, allowing self-hosted deployments to connect to any compatible API.

By setting the OpenAI provider configuration, you can point Chat UI at LLM API to access all available models.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Hugging Face Chat UI installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Hugging Face Chat UI

1. Open the .env file (or .env.local) in your Chat UI installation.
2. Set your LLM API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-llm-api-key-here
```

3. Configure the MODELS environment variable to use LLM API:

```json
MODELS=\`[{
"name": "GPT-4o via LLM API",
"id": "openai/gpt-4o",
"endpoints": [{
"type": "openai",
"baseURL": "https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
}]
}]\`
```

4. Restart Chat UI --- the configured models will appear in the model selector.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Hugging Face Chat UI can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	You can add multiple models to the MODELS array, each using the same LLM API
	endpoint but with different model IDs.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Hugging Face Chat UI

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests

<Callout type="info">
	View all available models on the [models page](https://llmapi.ai/models).
