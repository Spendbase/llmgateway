Voilà is a browser-based AI assistant that provides writing assistance, summarization, translation, and coding help on any webpage. It supports bringing your own API keys for direct model access.

Voilà's BYOK feature supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints, letting you connect LLM API.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Voila installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Voilà

1. Open Voilà in your browser.
2. Navigate to Settings → "Bring Your Own Key".
3. Select "OpenAI" or "Custom" provider.
4. Enter:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Click "Save".

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Voila can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
