AnyChat is a multi-model AI chat platform that provides a unified interface for interacting with various language models. It supports quick setup with bring-your-own-API-key functionality, letting users connect their preferred AI providers.

AnyChat supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints, making it simple to add LLM API as a provider.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- AnyChat installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">

	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in AnyChat

1. Open AnyChat and navigate to Settings.
2. Find the "API Keys" or "Provider" configuration section.
3. Select "OpenAI Compatible" or "Custom" as the provider.
4. Enter the following details:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Enter the model ID you wish to use (e.g., openai/gpt-4o).
6. Click "Save" to apply the settings.
7. Start a new chat --- messages will be routed through LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that AnyChat can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.
