LLMChat is an open-source, privacy-first AI chat application that runs locally. It supports multiple AI providers and offers features like conversation history, prompt templates, and image generation.

LLMChat supports custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints through its provider settings.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- LLM Chat installed or accessible

### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)
