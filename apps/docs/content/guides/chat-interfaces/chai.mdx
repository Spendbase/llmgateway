Chai is a platform for building and interacting with AI chatbots. It provides tools for developers to create engaging conversational characters and deploy them to a large user base, with support for custom model backends.

Chai's developer platform supports custom API endpoints, allowing you to connect LLM API as the model backend for your chatbots.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Chai installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Chai

1. Sign up for a Chai developer account at chai-research.com.
2. Navigate to your bot's Model Configuration settings.
3. Select "Custom" or "OpenAI Compatible" as the model backend.
4. Enter the following details:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **Model**: the model ID you wish to use
5. Click "Save" to apply.
6. Test your bot --- responses will now be generated via LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Chai can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

<Callout type="info">
	Using LLM API gives you access to a wide range of models to find the best fit
	for your chatbot's personality and use case.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Chai

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
