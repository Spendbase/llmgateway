ChatBox is a desktop AI chat application available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It supports multiple providers and offers a clean interface for chatting with AI models, with full support for custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

ChatBox supports custom API providers, making it easy to connect LLM API.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- ChatBox installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in ChatBox

1. Open ChatBox on your desktop.
2. Navigate to Settings (gear icon).
3. Select "OpenAI API Compatible" as the provider.
4. Enter:
   - **API Host**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Model**: the model ID you wish to use
5. Click "Save".

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that ChatBox can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.
