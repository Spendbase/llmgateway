OB-1 by Open Block Labs is a multi-model, terminal-based coding agent that supports over 300 AI models. It features bring-your-own-API-key functionality, self-optimizing workflows, and session forking, making it a versatile tool for AI-assisted development.

OB-1 supports OpenAI-compatible providers, allowing you to connect LLM API and access all available models from the terminal.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- OpenBlock Labs installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in OB-1

1. Open your terminal and launch OB-1.
2. Open the settings file at \~/.ob1/settings.json (or use the /model command in OB-1).
3. Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-llm-api-key-here"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
```

4. Alternatively, configure in \~/.ob1/settings.json:

```json
{
	"apiKey": "your-llm-api-key-here",
	"apiBase": "https://api.llmapi.ai/v1",
	"model": "openai/gpt-4o"
}
```

5. Use the /model command to switch between models at any time.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that OpenBlock Labs can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>

<Callout type="info">
	Use /model auto to let OB-1 intelligently route tasks to the optimal model
	based on complexity.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with OpenBlock Labs

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests

<Callout type="info">
	View all available models on the [models page](https://llmapi.ai/models).
