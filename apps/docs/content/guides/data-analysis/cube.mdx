Cube is a semantic layer and headless BI platform that provides a universal API for accessing data. It includes AI capabilities for natural language queries and data exploration.

Cube's AI API supports custom LLM providers.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Cube installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Cube

1. Open your Cube project configuration.
2. Configure the AI API settings:

```
\# cube.py or environment variables
CUBEJS_LLM_API_KEY=your-llm-api-key-here
CUBEJS_LLM_API_URL=https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
```

3. Restart Cube to apply.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Cube can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	Cube's AI API translates natural language questions into SQL using LLM API
	models.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Cube

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests

<Callout type="info">
	View all available models on the [models page](https://llmapi.ai/models).
