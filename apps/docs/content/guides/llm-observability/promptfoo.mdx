Promptfoo is an open-source tool for testing and evaluating LLM outputs. It lets you run prompt benchmarks across multiple models and providers, with support for custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

Promptfoo supports custom providers in its configuration file.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Promptfoo installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Promptfoo

1. Set environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-llm-api-key-here"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
```

2. Or configure in promptfooconfig.yaml:

```
providers:
\- id: openai:openai/gpt-4o
config:
apiKey: your-llm-api-key-here
apiBaseUrl: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
```

3. Run: promptfoo eval

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Promptfoo can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	Promptfoo lets you compare multiple LLM API models side by side with automated
	evaluations.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Promptfoo

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
