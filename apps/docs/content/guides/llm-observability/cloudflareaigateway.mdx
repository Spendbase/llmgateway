Cloudflare AI Gateway is a proxy that sits between your application and AI providers. It provides caching, rate limiting, logging, and analytics for AI API calls.

Configure Cloudflare AI Gateway to proxy requests to LLM API.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Cloudflare AI Gateway installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Route LLM API Through Cloudflare AI Gateway

1. Set up an AI Gateway in your Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Configure the gateway to use LLM API as the origin:
   - **Provider**: OpenAI Compatible
   - **Endpoint**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
3. Update your application to use the Cloudflare gateway URL with your LLM API key.
4. All requests will be proxied through Cloudflare to LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Cloudflare AI Gateway can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Cloudflare AI Gateway

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
