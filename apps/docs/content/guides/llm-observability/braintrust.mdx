Braintrust is an enterprise AI product stack that includes evaluation, logging, and a proxy for LLM applications. Its AI proxy provides caching, rate limiting, and unified access to multiple providers.

Braintrust's proxy can be configured to route requests to LLM API.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Braintrust installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API with Braintrust Proxy

1. Configure environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-llm-api-key-here"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
```

2. Or configure in Braintrust's project settings to use LLM API as a provider.
3. Braintrust will log and evaluate all LLM API interactions.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Braintrust can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.
