Langfuse is an open-source LLM engineering platform for tracing, evaluation, prompt management, and monitoring. It integrates with popular frameworks and supports custom LLM providers.

Langfuse traces LLM calls through its SDK wrappers. Configure the underlying provider to use LLM API.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Langfuse installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Use LLM API with Langfuse

1. Install Langfuse:

```bash
pip install langfuse openai
```

2. Configure:

```python
from langfuse.openai import openai
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-llm-api-key-here"
os.environ["OPENAI_BASE_URL"] = "https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "your-langfuse-key"
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "your-langfuse-public-key"
```

3. Langfuse will trace all LLM API calls automatically.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Langfuse can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	Langfuse's drop-in OpenAI wrapper captures every LLM API request for analysis.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Langfuse

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests

<Callout type="info">
	View all available models on the [models page](https://llmapi.ai/models).
