Novelcrafter is an AI-powered writing tool designed for fiction authors. It provides intelligent writing assistance, scene generation, character development, and story planning --- all with the option to bring your own API keys.

Novelcrafter supports custom API keys for multiple providers, including OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Novelcrafter installed or accessible

## Setup

### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
