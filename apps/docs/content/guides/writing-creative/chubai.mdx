Chub AI is a platform for discovering, sharing, and chatting with AI characters. It offers an extensive library of community-created character cards and supports bring-your-own-API-key connections so users can power their chats with their preferred AI models.

Chub AI's API Connections feature supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints, letting you use LLM API to access any model through a single key.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Chub AI installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

### Configure LLM API in Chub AI

1. Log in to your Chub AI account at chub.ai.
2. Navigate to Settings or API Connections.
3. Select "OpenAI" or "OpenAI Compatible" as the API type.
4. Enter the following details:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Reverse Proxy / Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Enter the model ID you want to use (e.g., openai/gpt-4o, anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet).
6. Click "Save" to apply your settings.
7. Start chatting --- all requests will now go through LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Chub AI can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API works as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI's API. Any Chub AI feature
	that supports OpenAI will work seamlessly with LLM API.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Chub AI

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
