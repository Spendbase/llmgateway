Writingmate is an AI writing assistant available as a browser extension and web app. It helps with content creation, editing, translation, and more, supporting custom API keys for direct model access.

Writingmate supports bring-your-own-key configurations.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Writingmate installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Writingmate

1. Open Writingmate settings.
2. Navigate to "API Keys" or "Model Settings".

   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Click "Save".

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Writingmate can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
