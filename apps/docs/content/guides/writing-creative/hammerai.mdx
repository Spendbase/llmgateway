HammerAI is a desktop AI chat application that runs locally on your computer. It supports multiple AI providers and allows you to bring your own API keys, giving you full control over which models you use and how your data is handled.

HammerAI supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints, making it easy to connect LLM API as a custom provider.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Hammer AI installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in HammerAI

1. Open HammerAI on your desktop.
2. Navigate to Settings (gear icon).
3. Under the API Provider section, select "OpenAI Compatible" or "Custom Provider".
4. Enter the following details:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL / Endpoint**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Enter the model ID you wish to use (e.g., openai/gpt-4o).
6. Click "Save" to apply.
7. Start a new chat --- HammerAI will now use LLM API for all requests.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Hammer AI can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Hammer AI

- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
