JanitorAI is a character-based AI chat platform that allows users to create and interact with AI-powered characters. It offers a rich library of community-created characters and supports multiple AI backends, including the option to connect your own API through a reverse proxy or OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

By configuring a custom API connection, you can point JanitorAI at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, including LLM API, to power your character chats with your preferred models.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Janitor AI installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in JanitorAI

1. Go to janitorai.com and log in to your account.
2. Click your profile icon in the top-right corner and select "API Settings" (or navigate to Settings).
3. Under the API configuration section, select "OpenAI" as the API type.
4. Enter the following details:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Reverse Proxy URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. In the Model field, enter the model ID you wish to use (e.g., openai/gpt-4o, anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet).
6. Click "Save" to apply the settings.
7. Start a new chat --- all requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Janitor AI can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	JanitorAI refers to custom endpoints as a "reverse proxy." LLM API works as a
	drop-in replacement since it is fully OpenAI-compatible.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Janitor AI

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
