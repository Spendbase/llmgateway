SillyTavern is an open-source, locally-installed frontend for interacting with large language models. It supports a wide range of AI APIs --- both local and cloud-based --- and provides a rich chat interface with character cards, group chats, and advanced prompt management.

SillyTavern's Chat Completion mode supports OpenAI-compatible APIs, which means you can connect it directly to LLM API to use any model available through your subscription.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- SillyTavern installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in SillyTavern

1. Open SillyTavern in your browser (typically at http://localhost:8000).
2. Click the plug icon to open the API Connections panel.
3. From the API dropdown at the top, select "Chat Completion".
4. In the Chat Completion Source dropdown, select "Custom (OpenAI-compatible)".
5. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Custom Endpoint (Base URL)**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
6. Enter the model name you want to use in the "Model" field (e.g., openai/gpt-4o, anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet).
7. Click "Connect" to test the connection.
8. Once connected, start or continue a chat --- all requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that SillyTavern can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

<Callout type="info">
	SillyTavern's Chat Completion mode sends messages in the OpenAI format. LLM
	API is fully compatible, so all features including streaming, token counting,
	and model switching work seamlessly.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with SillyTavern

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
