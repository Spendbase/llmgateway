SkyrimNet is a game modification plugin for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim that brings AI-powered NPC interactions to the game. It uses large language models to generate dynamic dialogue, behaviors, and narrative events, creating a more immersive and responsive game world.

SkyrimNet supports custom LLM endpoints, allowing you to point its AI backend at LLM API for access to a wider range of models.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- SkyrimNet installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in SkyrimNet

1. Locate the SkyrimNet configuration file in your Skyrim mod directory.
2. Open the config file (typically SkyrimNet.ini or a JSON configuration).
3. Set the API endpoint and key:
   - **API URL / Endpoint**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Model**: the model ID you wish to use (e.g., openai/gpt-4o)
4. Save the configuration file.
5. Launch Skyrim with SkyrimNet enabled --- AI interactions will now use LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that SkyrimNet can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

	Faster models like GPT-4o-mini provide quicker NPC response times for a more
	fluid gameplay experience.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with SkyrimNet

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
