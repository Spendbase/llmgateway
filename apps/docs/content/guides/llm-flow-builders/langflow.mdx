Langflow is a visual framework for building multi-agent and RAG applications. It provides a drag-and-drop interface for connecting LLM components, data sources, and tools into complex AI workflows.

Langflow's model components support OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Langflow installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Langflow

1. Open Langflow in your browser.
2. Drag an "OpenAI" or "ChatOpenAI" component onto the canvas.
3. Click the component and configure:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **Model Name**: openai/gpt-4o
4. Connect the component to your flow and run.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Langflow can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Langflow

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
