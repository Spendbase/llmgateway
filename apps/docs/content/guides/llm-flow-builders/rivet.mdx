Rivet is a visual programming environment by Ironclad for building, testing, and deploying AI agent workflows. It uses a node-based graph editor where you can visually connect AI models, data sources, and logic nodes to create complex AI pipelines.

Rivet supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints in its Chat nodes, allowing you to connect LLM API as your AI backend.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Rivet installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Rivet

1. Open Rivet and create or open a project.
2. Click the Settings icon and navigate to the "OpenAI" or "Plugins" section.
3. Set the OpenAI API configuration:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
4. In your graph, add a Chat node and set the model to your desired LLM API model (e.g., openai/gpt-4o).
5. Run the graph --- all Chat node requests will be routed through LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Rivet can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

<Callout type="info">
	Rivet's visual interface makes it easy to test different models by simply
	changing the model ID in the Chat node.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Rivet

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
