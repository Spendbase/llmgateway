MindStudio is a no-code platform for building AI-powered applications and workflows. It allows users to create custom AI assistants, automate tasks, and integrate multiple AI models --- all with the option to bring your own API keys for direct model access and cost control.

MindStudio supports custom API keys for major providers and OpenAI-compatible endpoints, letting you connect LLM API for model access.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- MindStudio installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in MindStudio

1. Log in to MindStudio at mindstudio.ai.
2. Open your workspace settings or navigate to the API Keys section.
3. Click "Add API Key" or select the OpenAI/Custom provider option.
4. Enter the following details:
   - **Provider**: OpenAI Compatible
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Click "Save" to store the configuration.
6. Select LLM API models when building your AI workflows.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that MindStudio can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

	Using your own API key through LLM API gives you direct control over costs and
	model selection for all your MindStudio applications.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with MindStudio

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
