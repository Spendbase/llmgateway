Flowise is an open-source drag-and-drop tool for building customized LLM flows. It lets you connect ChatModels, Document Loaders, Vector Stores, and Agents into visual workflows.

Flowise's ChatOpenAI node supports custom base URLs, making LLM API integration straightforward.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Flowise installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Flowise

1. Open Flowise and create a new chatflow.
2. Drag a "ChatOpenAI" node onto the canvas.
3. Configure:
   - **OpenAI API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base Path**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **Model Name**: openai/gpt-4o
4. Connect to other nodes and save the chatflow.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Flowise can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

	Flowise's credential management lets you save your LLM API key once and reuse
	it across flows.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Flowise

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
