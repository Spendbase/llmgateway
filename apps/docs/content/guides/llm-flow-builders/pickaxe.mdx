Pickaxe is a no-code platform for building AI-powered tools and chatbots. It lets you create interactive AI applications by combining prompts, data sources, and models without writing code.

Pickaxe supports custom model providers for powering your AI tools.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Pickaxe installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Pickaxe

1. Log in to Pickaxe at pickaxe.co.
2. Navigate to Settings → Models or API Configuration.

4. Enter:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Select the model for your tools.
6. Click "Save".

</Step>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Pickaxe

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
