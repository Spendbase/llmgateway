Dify is a low-code platform for building AI-powered applications with workflow automation, RAG pipelines, and agent capabilities. It supports a wide range of model providers and allows workspace administrators to manage API keys and model access centrally.

Dify's Model Providers feature supports OpenAI-compatible APIs, allowing you to add LLM API as a custom provider for all your Dify applications.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Dify installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Add LLM API as a Model Provider in Dify

1. Log in to your Dify workspace as an admin or owner.
2. Navigate to Settings → Model Providers.
3. Find "OpenAI-API-compatible" in the provider list and click to configure.
4. Enter the following details:
   - **Model Name**: the model ID you wish to use (e.g., openai/gpt-4o)
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **API Endpoint URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Click "Save" --- Dify will validate the credentials before enabling the provider.
6. The model will now be available for selection in your Dify applications.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Dify can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	You can add multiple model configurations under the same provider. Each can
	use a different model ID while sharing the same LLM API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Dify

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests

	View all available models on the [models page](https://llmapi.ai/models).
