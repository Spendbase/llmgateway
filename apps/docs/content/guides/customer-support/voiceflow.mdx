Voiceflow is a collaborative platform for designing, prototyping, and building conversational AI experiences for chat and voice interfaces. It supports custom AI model providers.

Voiceflow's AI features support custom endpoints for model access.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Voiceflow installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Voiceflow

1. Open Voiceflow and navigate to your project.
2. Go to Integrations → AI Model Settings.
3. Select "Custom" or "OpenAI Compatible".
4. Enter:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Select the model.
6. Click "Save".

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Voiceflow can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Voiceflow

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
