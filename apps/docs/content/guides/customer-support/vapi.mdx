Vapi is a platform for building, testing, and deploying AI voice agents. It provides APIs for creating conversational voice experiences with support for custom LLM providers for the AI backend.

Vapi supports custom LLM providers through its dashboard configuration.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Vapi installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Vapi

1. Log in to your Vapi dashboard at vapi.ai.
2. Navigate to Provider Keys or Model Settings.
3. Click "Add Key" and select "Custom / OpenAI Compatible".
4. Enter:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Click "Save".
6. Select the LLM API model when configuring your voice agent.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Vapi can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

	inference endpoints.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Vapi

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
