Jupyter AI is an extension for JupyterLab that adds AI-powered features including a chat interface, magic commands for inline AI assistance, and support for multiple model providers.

Jupyter AI supports custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints through its provider settings.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Jupyter AI installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Jupyter AI

1. Install Jupyter AI:

```bash
pip install jupyter-ai
```

2. In JupyterLab, open the AI chat panel and navigate to Settings.
3. Select "OpenAI" as the provider.
4. Set environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-llm-api-key-here"
export OPENAI_API_BASE="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
```

5. Select the model in the Jupyter AI settings panel.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Jupyter AI can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Jupyter AI

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
