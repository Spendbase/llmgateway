Marimo is a modern, reactive Python notebook that supports AI-powered code completion and assistance. It provides an OpenAI-compatible configuration for AI features.

Marimo's AI completion supports custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Marimo installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Marimo

1. Set environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-llm-api-key-here"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
```

2. Or configure in marimo settings:

```
\# In marimo.toml or settings
[ai]
api_key = "your-llm-api-key-here"
base_url = "https://api.llmapi.ai/v1"
model = "openai/gpt-4o"
```

3. Restart Marimo --- AI completion will use LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Marimo can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Marimo

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
