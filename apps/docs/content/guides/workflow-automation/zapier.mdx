Zapier is the most popular no-code workflow automation platform, connecting 6,000+ apps. Its AI features and actions let you add language model capabilities to any automated workflow (Zap).

Zapier supports custom API connections through its webhook and API actions, letting you connect LLM API.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Zapier installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Use LLM API in Zapier

1. Create or edit a Zap in Zapier.
2. Add a "Webhooks by Zapier" action (POST request).
3. Configure the webhook:
   - **URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1/chat/completions
   - **Headers**: Authorization: Bearer your-llm-api-key-here, Content-Type: application/json
4. Set the request body with your model and messages in JSON format.
5. Test the step.
6. Continue building your Zap with the AI response.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Zapier can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Zapier

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
