Activepieces is an open-source workflow automation platform with a user-friendly interface. It supports AI pieces (modules) for integrating language models into automation flows.

Activepieces' AI pieces support custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Activepieces installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Activepieces

1. Open Activepieces and navigate to your flow.
2. Add an AI piece (e.g., "Ask AI" or "OpenAI").
3. Click "New Connection" for the AI piece.
4. Enter:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Select the model and configure the prompt.
6. Save and run the flow.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Activepieces can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.
