Make (formerly Integromat) is a visual workflow automation platform that connects apps and services. It supports AI modules for integrating language model capabilities into automated workflows.

Make's OpenAI and HTTP modules support custom endpoints, allowing you to route AI requests through LLM API.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Make installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Make

1. Open Make and navigate to your scenario.
2. Add an "OpenAI" module or "HTTP" module.
3. If using OpenAI module, click "Add" next to Connection.
4. Enter:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. For HTTP module, configure a POST request to https://api.llmapi.ai/v1/chat/completions with Authorization: Bearer your-key.
6. Click "OK" to save.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Make can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

	Make's visual workflow builder makes it easy to chain LLM API calls with
	hundreds of other services.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Make

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
