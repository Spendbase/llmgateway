Latenode is a low-code automation platform that combines visual workflow building with code capabilities. It supports AI nodes for integrating language model functionality.

Latenode supports custom LLM connections for its AI nodes.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Latenode installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Latenode

1. Open Latenode and create or edit a scenario.
2. Add an "AI" or "Custom LLM" node.
3. Configure:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **Model**: the model ID you wish to use
4. Save and run.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Latenode can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

	Latenode's code blocks let you write custom logic around LLM API calls for
	advanced workflows.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Latenode

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
