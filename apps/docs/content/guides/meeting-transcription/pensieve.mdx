Pensieve is an open-source meeting recording and transcription tool. It records your screen and microphone, transcribes meetings locally, and can use AI for summaries and action items.

Pensieve supports custom LLM endpoints for AI-powered summaries.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Pensieve installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Pensieve

1. Open Pensieve settings.
2. Navigate to the AI/LLM configuration section.
3. Set:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
4. Save settings.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Pensieve can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Pensieve

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests

<Callout type="info">
	View all available models on the [models page](https://llmapi.ai/models).
