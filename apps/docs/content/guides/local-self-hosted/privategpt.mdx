PrivateGPT is a production-ready AI project that allows you to interact with your documents using LLMs while keeping everything 100% private. It supports both local models and cloud API providers.

PrivateGPT's settings.yaml supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints for cloud model access.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- PrivateGPT installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in PrivateGPT

1. Open the settings.yaml file in your PrivateGPT installation.
2. Configure the OpenAI provider:

```
llm:
mode: openai
openai:
api_key: your-llm-api-key-here
api_base: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
model: openai/gpt-4o
```

3. Save the file and restart PrivateGPT.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that PrivateGPT can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with PrivateGPT

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
