KoboldAI is an open-source browser-based front-end for text generation AI models. It's popular among creative writers for story generation, roleplay, and interactive fiction, with support for both local and remote models.

KoboldAI's OpenAI-compatible mode lets you connect remote endpoints like LLM API.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- KoboldAI installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in KoboldAI

1. Open KoboldAI in your browser.
2. Click "AI" in the top menu and select "Connect to OpenAI-compatible API".
3. Enter:
   - **API Endpoint**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
4. Select the model ID.
5. Click "Connect".

```yaml
Tip: KoboldAI's advanced generation settings (temperature, top-p, etc.) work with all LLM API models.
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that KoboldAI can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with KoboldAI

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
