Sourcegraph Cody is an enterprise AI coding assistant that understands your entire codebase. It provides context-aware code generation, explanations, and refactoring powered by large language models, with support for custom model providers through the site configuration.

Cody Enterprise supports custom OpenAI-compatible providers through provider overrides in the site config, letting you connect LLM API for your organization.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Sourcegraph Cody installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Sourcegraph Cody (Enterprise)

1. Open your Sourcegraph instance's Site Configuration.
2. Add a provider override in the modelConfiguration section:

```json
"modelConfiguration": {
"providerOverrides": [{
"id": "llm-api",
"displayName": "LLM API",
"serverSideConfig": {
"type": "openaicompatible",
"endpoints": [{
"url": "https://api.llmapi.ai/v1/",
"accessToken": "your-llm-api-key-here"
}]
}
}]
}
```

3. Add a model override to register specific models:

```json
"modelOverrides": [{
"modelRef": "llm-api::v1::openai/gpt-4o",
"modelName": "openai/gpt-4o",
"displayName": "GPT-4o via LLM API",
"contextWindow": {
"maxInputTokens": 128000,
"maxOutputTokens": 4096
},
"capabilities": ["chat"]
}]
```

4. Save the site configuration. Cody will now offer LLM API models to users.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Sourcegraph Cody can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	You can validate the configuration by checking the supported models endpoint: \${INSTANCE\_URL}/.api/modelconfig/supported-models.json
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Sourcegraph Cody

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
