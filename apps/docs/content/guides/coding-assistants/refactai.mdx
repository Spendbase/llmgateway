Refact.ai is an open-source AI coding assistant that provides code completion, refactoring, and chat capabilities. It supports self-hosting and connecting to custom LLM providers for full control over your AI coding experience.

Refact.ai's configuration supports custom endpoints, allowing you to connect LLM API as your model provider.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Refact.ai installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Refact.ai

1. Open your IDE with the Refact.ai extension installed.
2. Open Refact.ai settings.
3. Navigate to the "Model" or "Inference" section.
4. Set the following:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Endpoint URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Select or enter the model ID.
6. Save and restart the extension.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Refact.ai can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

	Refact.ai's self-hosted mode can also be configured to proxy through LLM API
	for team deployments.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Refact.ai

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
