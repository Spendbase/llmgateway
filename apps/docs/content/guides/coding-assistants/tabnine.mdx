Tabnine is an AI-powered code completion and assistance tool that integrates into popular IDEs. It supports both proprietary Tabnine models and third-party LLMs including GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini, with enterprise customers able to connect private model endpoints.

Tabnine Enterprise supports custom model endpoints, allowing you to connect LLM API for AI chat and code assistance within your IDE.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Tabnine installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Tabnine

1. Open your IDE with Tabnine installed (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.).
2. Open Tabnine settings from the Tabnine panel.
3. Navigate to the Model Configuration or Chat Model section.
4. Select a third-party model or add a custom endpoint:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Endpoint URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Select the model you want to use.
6. Save settings --- Tabnine will now route AI requests through LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Tabnine can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

	Tabnine Enterprise administrators can configure LLM API as the default
	provider for all team members through the admin settings.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Tabnine

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
