Roo Code is an AI-powered coding assistant that runs inside Visual Studio Code. It helps developers write, debug, and refactor code using large language models, with support for multiple API providers including OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

Roo Code's flexible provider system lets you connect any OpenAI-compatible API, including LLM API, to power its AI features.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Roo Code installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Connect LLM API to Roo Code

1. Open Visual Studio Code and make sure the Roo Code extension is installed.
2. Click the Roo Code icon in the Activity Bar (left sidebar) to open the Roo Code panel.
3. Open Roo Code Settings (gear icon in the panel).
4. In the "API Provider" dropdown, select "OpenAI Compatible".
5. Fill in the following fields:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
6. In the Model field, enter the model ID you wish to use (e.g., openai/gpt-4o, anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet).
7. Click "Save" or press Enter to apply the settings.
8. Start a new Roo Code task --- all requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Roo Code can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API supports all major model families. You can switch models at any time
	from the Roo Code settings panel without changing your API key.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Roo Code

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
