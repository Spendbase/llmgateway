Factory is an AI-powered software development platform that provides autonomous coding agents (Droids) capable of handling complex engineering tasks including code generation, bug fixes, migrations, and testing.

Factory supports custom LLM providers for its Droids, allowing you to connect LLM API as the AI backend.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Factory installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Factory

1. Log in to your Factory dashboard.
2. Navigate to Settings → LLM Provider.
3. Select "Custom" or "OpenAI Compatible".
4. Enter the following:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Select the model for your Droids.
6. Click "Save".

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Factory can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

	Factory's Droids benefit from powerful reasoning models. LLM API gives you
	access to the latest options.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Factory

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
