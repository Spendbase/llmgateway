CodeGPT is a VS Code extension and coding assistant that connects to multiple AI providers. It offers code generation, explanations, documentation, and refactoring, with full support for custom API endpoints.

CodeGPT supports OpenAI-compatible APIs through its provider settings, making it easy to connect LLM API.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- CodeGPT installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in CodeGPT

1. Open VS Code with the CodeGPT extension installed.
2. Click the CodeGPT icon in the sidebar.
3. In the provider dropdown, select "Custom" or "OpenAI Compatible".
4. Enter the following:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Enter the model ID you wish to use.
6. Click "Save" to apply.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that CodeGPT can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with CodeGPT

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
