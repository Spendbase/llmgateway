Pieces for Developers is an AI-powered productivity tool suite that helps developers save, enrich, search, and share code snippets. It includes a desktop app, browser extensions, and IDE plugins, all powered by a local-first AI engine (PiecesOS) with optional cloud model support.

Pieces supports custom LLM providers through PiecesOS configuration, allowing you to connect LLM API for AI-powered features.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Pieces installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Pieces

1. Open the Pieces Desktop App.
2. Navigate to Settings → Machine Learning / Model Configuration.
3. Select "Custom" or "OpenAI Compatible" as the cloud model provider.
4. Enter the following details:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Endpoint URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Select the model you wish to use.
6. Click "Save" to apply.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Pieces can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
	PiecesOS handles the connection locally, so your API key stays on your
	machine.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Pieces

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
