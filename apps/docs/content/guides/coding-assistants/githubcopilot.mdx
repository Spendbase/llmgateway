GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that integrates into popular IDEs. It provides real-time code suggestions, chat-based assistance, and agent capabilities powered by large language models from multiple providers.

GitHub Copilot supports bring-your-own-key configurations through GitHub Models, letting you use your own API keys for supported providers.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- GitHub Copilot installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Use Custom API Keys with GitHub Copilot

1. Navigate to github.com/settings/copilot.
2. Under "Model provider keys," click "Add key".
3. Select the provider and enter:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
4. Configure the endpoint if prompted:
   - **Base URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Click "Save" to store the key.
6. Select the model in your IDE's Copilot settings.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that GitHub Copilot can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.
