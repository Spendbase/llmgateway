Zed is a high-performance, modern code editor built for speed and collaboration. It includes built-in AI features through its Agent Panel, supporting multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

Zed's settings file lets you add custom OpenAI-compatible providers, making it easy to connect LLM API for AI-assisted coding.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Zed installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Zed

1. Open Zed and access the Agent Panel settings (run the command: agent: open settings).
2. Add the following configuration to your Zed settings file:

```json
{
	"language_models": {
		"openai_compatible": {
			"LLM API": {
				"api_url": "https://api.llmapi.ai/v1",
				"available_models": [
					{
						"name": "openai/gpt-4o",
						"display_name": "GPT-4o via LLM API",
						"max_tokens": 128000
					}
				]
			}
		}
	}
}
```

3. Set the API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export LLM_API_API_KEY="your-llm-api-key-here"
```

4. Restart Zed --- your LLM API models will appear in the Agent Panel model dropdown.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Zed can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

</Step>

<Callout type="info">
	The environment variable name is derived from the provider name: spaces become
	underscores, converted to uppercase, with \_API\_KEY appended.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Zed

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
