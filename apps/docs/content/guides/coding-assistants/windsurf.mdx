Windsurf (formerly Codeium) is an AI-powered coding assistant that integrates into popular IDEs including VS Code, JetBrains, Vim, and others. It provides intelligent autocomplete, AI chat, and code editing features powered by advanced language models.

Windsurf supports custom model endpoints for enterprise deployments, allowing you to connect LLM API as your AI backend.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Windsurf installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Windsurf

1. Open your IDE with the Windsurf extension installed.
2. Open Windsurf Settings (click the Windsurf icon, then Settings).
3. Navigate to the "Model" or "Enterprise" configuration section.
4. Configure the custom endpoint:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **API Endpoint**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
5. Click "Save" to apply the settings.
6. Restart your IDE --- Windsurf will now use LLM API for all AI features.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Windsurf can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Windsurf

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
