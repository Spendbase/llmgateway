Continue is an open-source AI coding assistant that integrates directly into VS Code and JetBrains IDEs. It supports a wide range of model providers --- both cloud and local --- and lets developers customize their AI experience through a simple YAML configuration file.

Continue's config.yaml supports OpenAI-compatible providers, making it easy to connect LLM API as your model backend.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- Continue installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in Continue

1. Open your Continue configuration file (\~/.continue/config.yaml or your project's .continue/config.yaml).
2. Add LLM API as a model provider:

```
models:
\- name: "GPT-4o via LLM API"
provider: openai
model: openai/gpt-4o
apiKey: your-llm-api-key-here
apiBase: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
roles:
\- chat
\- edit
\- apply
```

3. Save the file. Continue will automatically reload the configuration.
4. Open Continue in your IDE --- the LLM API model will appear in the model selector.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that Continue can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

<Callout type="info">
	You can add multiple model entries with different model IDs, all sharing the
	same LLM API key and base URL.
</Callout>

## Benefits of Using LLM API with Continue

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
