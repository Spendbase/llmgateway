JetBrains AI Assistant is an AI-powered coding companion built into all JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.). It provides code generation, refactoring suggestions, natural language explanations, and an integrated AI chat panel.

JetBrains AI supports custom OpenAI-compatible providers, letting you connect LLM API as your model backend.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM API account with an API key
- JetBrains AI installed or accessible

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get Your LLM API Key

1. Log in to your [LLM API dashboard](https://app.llmapi.ai/api-keys)
2. Click **Create Key to Start**
3. Copy your new API key immediately — it will only be shown once
4. Store the key securely (e.g., in a password manager or `.env` file)

<Callout type="info">
	LLM API is an OpenAI-compatible gateway that gives you access to dozens of AI
	models through a single API key and endpoint.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure LLM API in JetBrains AI

1. Open your JetBrains IDE (IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.).
2. Navigate to Settings → Tools → AI Assistant → LLM Providers.
3. Click "+" to add a new provider and select "OpenAI API Compatible".
4. Enter the following:
   - **API Key**: paste the key you copied from app.llmapi.ai/api-keys
   - **Endpoint URL**: https://api.llmapi.ai/v1
   - **Model**: the model ID you wish to use
5. Click "OK" to save.
6. Select the LLM API provider in the AI Assistant panel.

</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Integration

Verify that JetBrains AI can successfully communicate with LLM API by sending a test request. All requests will now be routed through LLM API.

## Benefits of Using LLM API with JetBrains AI

- **Multi-Provider Access**: Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API
- **Cost Control**: Track and limit your AI spending with detailed usage analytics
- **Unified Billing**: One account for all providers instead of managing multiple API keys
- **Caching**: Reduce costs with response caching for repeated requests
